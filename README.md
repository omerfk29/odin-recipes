# My Recipes Project

I'm gonna make a basic html project that links to recipes of my favourite foods.

##

To run this project(on this computer) drag the .html file onto google browser and it should
just work from there.

##

To use this site just press on which food you wanna make and boom it'll take you to a recipe
site.
